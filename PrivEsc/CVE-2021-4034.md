This exploit was tested on Kali 2021.4 (not patched as of 01/26/2022; once apt update & apt upgrade completed on this day, the system was no longer vulnerable)

The link to the original repo where I got this exploit is here: https://github.com/berdav/CVE-2021-4034

You need to clone the repo, cd into the repo dir, run make with sudo permissions, and then execute the ./cve-2021-4034 file. 

However, since make requires sudo permissions for this, it's necessary to run make on a system with sudo privileges, then zip up the entire repo.

Once this is done, the zip file can be uploaded to the vulnerable target machine. The file must then be unzipped. Then, simply cd into the new directory and run te exploit. 



Commands to zip from attack machine: sudo zip -r [desired_filename] CVE-2021-4034
Commands to unzip from target: unzip [desired_filename].zip
